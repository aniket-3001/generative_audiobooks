/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000225.wav|2|OR HAD A GREAT BOMB , AS LARGE AS AN OVERSIZED METEOR , COME SELF-PROPELLED FROM SPACE , TO BURY ITSELF DEEP IN THAT ANCIENT WORLD ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001302.wav|4|AND ROUND MY FOREHEAD FROM THE BACK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000231.wav|2|BUT IN SWIFT SECONDS , GREAT CHUNKS OF THE PLANET'S CRUST MUST HAVE BEEN HURLED OUTWARD . IN A MOMENT THE FLAME MUST HAVE DIED ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000376.wav|4|THERE WAS A TIME OF ABSOLUTE QUIETNESS THEN FOR PERHAPS A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HORRIBLE I FELT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000352.wav|1|SAID THE MOUSE , TURNING TO ALICE , AND SIGHING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000489.wav|1|ALICE KNEW IT WAS THE RABBIT COMING TO LOOK FOR HER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000731.wav|4|WENTWORTH STARED , FEELING SUDDENLY RATHER CHILLY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000789.wav|4|DURING THE WHOLE OF THE EXAMINATION , I GOT WENTWORTH TO STAND GUARD WITH HIS LOADED SHOTGUN AND I WAS VERY PARTICULAR THAT WE WERE NEVER CAUGHT THERE AFTER DUSK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000719.wav|4|THEY HAD ALL BROUGHT STICKS SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRETTY FORMIDABLE LOT TO TACKLE BY ANYTHING SIMPLY PHYSICAL AND , OF COURSE , WENTWORTH HAD HIS GUN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000061.wav|4|AND , BY JOVE ! HE WAS RIGHT , AS YOU WILL SEE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000316.wav|4|I ASK QUESTIONS , AND KEEP MY EYES OPEN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000362.wav|1|WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY , THEN THE MICE WILL PLAY , BUT , ALAS ! ONE DAY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000401.wav|4|WITH THE CAT LYING HALF IN , AND HALF OUT UPON THE FLOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000683.wav|4|AND THERE GET A COUPLE OF DOZEN BOTTLES OF WHISKY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000474.wav|4|TWICE MORE WAS THE BODY OF THE DEAD CAT MOLESTED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002331.wav|4|I THREW THE CALIPERS DOWN , PAID THE PHOTOGRAPHER , AND WALKED OUT THROUGH THE SHOP INTO THE STREET .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001490.wav|4|ONE BY FALLING FROM A WINDOW ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000237.wav|4|MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING TO THINK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002123.wav|4|I HEARD SOMETHING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001456.wav|4|WITH PERHAPS LITTLE MORE THAN A HAND OR ARM OR PORTION OF THE HEAD OR DRESS INCLUDED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000079.wav|1|SO SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000132.wav|1|CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER ! CRIED ALICE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001194.wav|2|AND THEY'VE GOT THREE CHILDREN !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001024.wav|4|FORTUNATELY , I HAD BROUGHT MY CAMERA AWAY FROM THE HOUSE POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE STRAP HAD HAPPENED TO BE OVER MY HEAD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000080.wav|4|AND WENT HERE AND THERE ABOUT MY WORK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000071.wav|4|I LEFT HIM THERE , AND EXAMINED THE ROOM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000537.wav|2|WE WERE UP TO THOSE OLD BUILDINGS ! WE FOUND THE PEOPLE !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000375.wav|4|AND I HEARD THE FLUMP THEY MADE AS THEY WERE HURLED INTO THE CORNER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000183.wav|1|I'M SURE I'M NOT GERTRUDE , SHE SAID ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001004.wav|2|STILL DRAGGING HIM , ENDLICH WENT AND GOT A BUSHEL BASKET .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002181.wav|4|AND SO YOU MUST PICTURE ME SITTING THERE IN THE DARK CLUMSY WITH ARMOR , AND WITH MY REVOLVER IN ONE HAND ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000495.wav|2|THEIR RETURN TO CAMP , HUNDREDS OF MILES DISTANT , COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000315.wav|4|BUT , THEN , AS YOU ALL KNOW , I NEVER DID , AND NEVER WILL , ALLOW MYSELF TO BE BLINDED BY THE LITTLE CHEAP LAUGHTER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000263.wav|4|THEN I LEFT THE HOUSE , AS I WANTED TO GET CERTAIN MATTERS AND IMPLEMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO LIFE PERHAPS TO THE SPIRIT FOR I INTENDED TO SPEND THE COMING NIGHT IN THE GREY ROOM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001457.wav|4|ALL OF THESE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN TAKEN WITH SOME DEFINITE AIM THAT DID NOT HAVE FOR ITS FIRST PURPOSE THE PICTURING OF THE GIRL , BUT OBVIOUSLY OF HER SURROUNDINGS AND THEY MADE ME VERY CURIOUS , AS YOU CAN IMAGINE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001976.wav|4|JUST UNDER THE COLLARBONE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000373.wav|4|AND THEN , YOU KNOW , ALL IN A MOMENT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000499.wav|2|MAYBE , ALREADY , MORTAL DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE . BUT ENDLICH COULDN'T LIE DOWN AND QUIT , ANY MORE THAN A SNAKE , TOSSED INTO A FIRE , COULD STOP TRYING TO CRAWL OUT OF IT , AS LONG AS LIFE LASTED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000637.wav|1|KEEP YOUR TEMPER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000650.wav|4|THERE HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE TO INDICATE THE METHOD BY WHICH DEATH WAS CAUSED ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000600.wav|1|AND HER EYES IMMEDIATELY MET THOSE OF A LARGE BLUE CATERPILLAR , WHICH WAS SITTING WITH ITS ARMS FOLDED , QUIETLY SMOKING A LONG HOOKAH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002052.wav|4|HE NODDED AND TOLD ME HE FELT THE SAME WAY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000004.wav|1|AND WHERE IS THE USE OF A BOOK , THOUGHT ALICE , WITHOUT PICTURES OR CONVERSATIONS ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000619.wav|2|BUT HE KNEW HOPELESSLY THAT THINGS WEREN'T QUITE THAT SIMPLE , EITHER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000872.wav|2|SOMEBODY YELLED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000725.wav|2|GREENERY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001935.wav|4|NATURALLY , THE FIRST THING TO DO , WAS TO TEST THIS PROBABILITY OF HUMAN AGENCY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000304.wav|2|A LOT OF THINGS THAT WAS HERE ONCE , WE'LL BRING BACK , WON'T WE , POP ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002026.wav|4|HE SAID GOODNIGHT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002161.wav|4|AND HE HAD DESCRIBED THE STUPENDOUS FORCE OF THE BLOW AS BEING LIKE THE KICK OF A GREAT HORSE YOU CAN SEE HOW UNCOMFORTABLY MY THOUGHTS WERE RUNNING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000771.wav|4|I ARRIVED BY THE NIGHT MAIL , AND PUT UP WITH WENTWORTH AT THE INN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002306.wav|4|UNTIL SUDDENLY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IN ONE OF TWO PLACES THEY CERTAINLY HAD SHAPES SUGGESTIVE OF A CROSS HILTED DAGGER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000634.wav|4|IT SEEMS THAT WHEN WENTWORTH WENT OVER TO TAKE POSSESSION , HE FOUND THE PLACE IN VERY POOR REPAIR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000136.wav|1|I WONDER WHO WILL PUT ON YOUR SHOES AND STOCKINGS FOR YOU NOW , DEARS ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000975.wav|2|WHAT'S THIS ? WHAT HAPPENED ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000046.wav|1|AND JUMPED ON TO HER FEET DIRECTLY SHE LOOKED UP , BUT IT WAS ALL DARK OVERHEAD BEFORE HER WAS ANOTHER LONG PASSAGE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000331.wav|4|I DID NOT KNOW , AND COULD ONLY BE PREPARED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001351.wav|4|I KNEW THAT IT MIGHT , VERY POSSIBLY , HAVE SNAPPED , THROUGH MY HAVING TENSIONED IT TOO HIGHLY BUT THEN , AGAIN , IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROKEN BY SOMETHING ELSE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000398.wav|4|THAT CEASED ABRUPTLY AND THEN TOO LATE I SNAPPED OFF THE FLASHLIGHT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000593.wav|1|ALICE LOOKED ALL ROUND HER AT THE FLOWERS AND THE BLADES OF GRASS BUT COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO EAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000877.wav|1|PERHAPS EVEN WITH THESE VERY ADVENTURES OF THE LITTLE ALICE OF LONG-AGO AND HOW SHE WOULD FEEL WITH ALL THEIR SIMPLE SORROWS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000886.wav|2|LIKE THE FLICKER OF FLAME FLASHING THROUGH DRY GUNPOWDER , YOU COULD FEEL THE EXCITEMENT SPREAD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000269.wav|4|HE SAID , YES , SIR AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS , THINKING THAT I WAS GOING TO TURN IN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000782.wav|2|AND HAD FORCED TOWARD MATURITY , MOST .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001894.wav|4|FILLED HIS PIPE AND PUFFED FOR AWHILE , HIS GAZE DIRECTED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE FIRE .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000471.wav|4|I WAS IN SUCH FEAR THAT ANY DESIRE FOR ACTION THAT CAME TO ME MIGHT BE PROMPTED BY THE INFLUENCE THAT I KNEW WAS AT WORK ON ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000625.wav|2|AND ALSO THE LETHAL PORTION OF THE COSMIC RAYS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002049.wav|4|AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING , I PLAYED BILLIARDS WITH YOUNG JARNOCK FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000819.wav|4|AFTER I HAD DRAWN THE CIRCLE , I TOOK A BUNCH OF THE GARLIC , AND SMUDGED IT RIGHT ROUND THE CHALK CIRCLE , A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF IT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000407.wav|2|IF AN EVIL VISITATION CAME AS HE HAD BEEN ALL BUT SURE IT MUST THAT WOULD BE BAD , INDEED . IF IT DIDN'T COME WELL THAT STILL MEANT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT , AND THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE INEVITABLE .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000443.wav|4|THE DEAD BODY OF THE CAT WAS PICKED UP ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000404.wav|2|LEAVING HIS HARRASSED SIRE TO ENDURE THE VIGIL ALONE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000682.wav|1|SAID THE CATERPILLAR LOUDLY AND ANGRILY ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001085.wav|4|THIS MUST HAVE WARNED THE HAUNTERS FOR WHEN WE DESCENDED TO A SECRET ROOM WHICH WE FOUND AT THE END OF A LONG AND NARROW PASSAGE IN THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000942.wav|2|AND SOMETHING BROUGHT BACK RESTORED FROM THE REMOTE PAST .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000401.wav|2|BUBS SAID OH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002000.wav|4|IN THE MEANWHILE , I TREATED THE CHAPEL DRASTICALLY , SOUNDING AND SCRUTINIZING THE WALLS AND FLOOR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000935.wav|4|THE EXTENT OF THE POWER TO AFFECT THE MATERIAL WAS NOW THE ONE CONSTANT , ANXIOUS QUESTIONING IN MY BRAIN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001908.wav|4|TO REMAIN PURELY ORNAMENTAL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000925.wav|2|YEAH BY SURPRISE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000077.wav|4|ALONG THE WALLS , OVER THE PICTURES , AND OVER THE FIREPLACE AND THE WALL CLOSETS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001951.wav|4|AND IT WAS AT THIS IDENTICAL INSTANT AND WHILST ALL THREE WERE LOOKING AT HIM ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002411.wav|4|SO IT'S PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO GET IN AND MEDDLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000628.wav|2|THEY ALL MOVED IN MUCH THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE LARGE ASTEROIDS , AND AT MUCH THE SAME VELOCITY SO THEIR RELATIVE SPEED HAD TO BE LOW .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000679.wav|4|AND THEN , ABRUPTLY , AN IDEA CAME TO HIM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000326.wav|1|FOUND IT ADVISABLE TO GO WITH EDGAR ATHELING TO MEET WILLIAM AND OFFER HIM THE CROWN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000566.wav|4|THE RING WAS THERE , CLOSE BESIDE ME , WHERE I HAD PUT IT .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000877.wav|4|SUDDENLY , THE DOGS SET UP A TREMENDOUS BARKING ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000879.wav|4|THEY CEASED THEIR NOISE JUST AS QUICKLY , AND SEEMED TO BE LISTENING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000450.wav|1|AND MUCH SOONER THAN SHE EXPECTED BEFORE SHE HAD DRUNK HALF THE BOTTLE ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001071.wav|4|AND I RAN QUICKLY BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE UPPER END .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000501.wav|4|AFTER THAT , I MADE A VERY CAREFUL SEARCH OF THE CORNER WHERE THE BEDCLOTHES HAD BEEN THROWN .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000557.wav|1|AS SHE WANDERED ABOUT IN THE WOOD ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000443.wav|2|AS ABRUPTLY AS IF A SWITCH HAD BEEN TURNED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000608.wav|1|BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THAT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000765.wav|4|THEN THE TENSION BROKE , AND THERE WAS A MAD RUSH FOR THE MAIN DOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000300.wav|2|THE RATTLE OF TRAFFIC . THE BABBLE OF WATER . THE BUZZ OF INSECTS . THE SMELL OF FLOWERS .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000918.wav|2|THEN HE SLAMMED HIS JETS WIDE ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000263.wav|2|JOHN ENDLICH'S LIPS MADE A SOUR LINE .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001144.wav|2|THE CROWD GAVE WITH MOCK CHEERS AND BRAVOS , AND DEMANDED MORE ACTION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000129.wav|4|AND I TOOK MY CANDLE AND SEALING WAX , AND SEALED THE DOORS OF ALL FIVE ROOMS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000908.wav|2|BOTH ARMORED BODIES , LACKING NOTHING IN INERTIA , TORE THROUGH THE TOUGH PLASTIC WINDOW , AND THEY BOUNCED LIGHTLY ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE MAIN SECTION OF THE REC-DOME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000531.wav|2|SO JOHN ENDLICH HAD TO TRY TO REPAIR THAT MAIN BATTERY .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000176.wav|1|AND YESTERDAY EVERYTHING HAPPENED JUST AS USUAL I WONDER IF I WAS CHANGED IN THE NIGHT ?

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000537.wav|4|THEN I WENT OUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR AFTER WHICH I LEFT THE HOUSE , TO GET CERTAIN MATTERS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000134.wav|4|THEN I LIT MY CANDLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000038.wav|1|SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS DOZING OFF ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000962.wav|4|AND SEEM TO STOP IN MY BRAIN .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000762.wav|4|AND THE HALL WAS SUDDENLY DARK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000673.wav|2|ROSE'S GLANCE WAS STRANGE ALMOST GUILTY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000802.wav|1|SLOWLY AND SADLY , THESE WORDS
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001257.wav|4|AT THE EAST END OF THE GALLERY WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE CORRIDOR OF THE EAST WING THIS WAS SHUT OFF FROM THE GALLERY BY TWO OLD AND HEAVY OAK DOORS ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000867.wav|4|IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR LATER THAT IT CAME TO ME SUDDENLY THAT I WAS AWARE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF DREENESS , AS IT WERE ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000220.wav|4|THERE CAME THE CRASHING THUD OF THE DOOR OF THE GREY ROOM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000278.wav|1|AND IT'LL FETCH THINGS WHEN YOU THROW THEM ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002303.wav|4|FOR SOME MINUTES FURTHER I WATCHED IT ,

SOMETIMES , LISTENING TO FAMILIAR SOUNDS , AND SMELLING FAMILIAR ODORS , TOWARD THE LATTER PART OF HIS REPRIEVE , HE ALMOST IMAGINED THAT HE'D ACCOMPLISHED HIS BASIC DESIRES HERE ON VESTA WHEN HE HAD ALWAYS FAILED ON EARTH .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000713.wav|4|I DO MANE YE TO B'LIEVE IT AN' PLEASE GOD , IF YE'LL B'LIEVE ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000807.wav|4|I DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING WITH THE OTHER HOUND BUT OVER MORE IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE BIG HALL , WHERE THE TWO ROWS OF DOORS MAKE THE ANGLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000265.wav|4|WHERE I PILED IT CAREFULLY IN THE CENTER OF THE FLOOR .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000939.wav|2|BROUGHT HIM A REGRET .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000066.wav|1|NOT LARGER THAN A RAT-HOLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000948.wav|2|TO STAND AND FIGHT , AS HE WOULD HAVE DONE IF HE WERE ALONE , WOULD MEAN SIMPLY THAT HE WOULD BE CUT DOWN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000903.wav|4|AND HE NODDED AND LOOKED ROUND , NERVOUSLY .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000366.wav|2|THOUGH THERE WAS BREATHABLE AIR AROUND THEM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000463.wav|2|A USEFUL TOOL OF HIS TRADE , BUT A HELLISH WEAPON , TOO , AT SHORT RANGE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001906.wav|4|UNTIL QUITE LATELY WHEN SOMETHING VERY DISAGREEABLE OCCURRED ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001997.wav|4|I MAY TELL YOU HERE AND NOW , THAT BEFORE I LEFT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001221.wav|4|WAS TO BE STUNNED BY REALIZATION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000917.wav|4|I HELD MY CAMERA READY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000484.wav|1|AND MAKING QUITE A CONVERSATION OF IT ALTOGETHER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001086.wav|2|HOW CAN YOU START BEATIN' , WHEN YOU AIN'T DONE EATIN' ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000131.wav|4|I RETURNED TO MY ROOM , LOCKED THE DOOR , AND WENT TO BED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000614.wav|4|I OPENED IT , AND FOUND A SMALL CIRCLE OF GREYISH METAL , SOMETHING LIKE LEAD , ONLY HARDER AND RATHER BRIGHTER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000195.wav|1|I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR FLORENCE !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000794.wav|2|HIS WARINESS SLIPPED INTO ABEYANCE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000200.wav|1|AND THE WORDS DID NOT SOUND THE SAME AS THEY USED TO DO HOW DOTH THE LITTLE CROCODILE IMPROVE ITS SHINING TAIL ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000670.wav|4|LEADING A GREAT BULLMASTIFF , AND OFFERED IT TO HIM , TO TAKE TO KEEP HIM COMPANY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002391.wav|4|I BROUGHT THE OLD WEAPON AND PLACED ITS HILT IN A HOLE NEAR THE TOP OF THE POST WHERE IT FITTED LOOSELY , THE POINT UPWARD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000875.wav|4|AND STARING IN AN EXTRAORDINARY FASHION TOWARD THE GREAT ENTRANCE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001134.wav|4|ONLY TO FIND THAT HE HAD BOUGHT A VERY PECULIAR PIECE OF PROPERTY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000882.wav|4|IT MOVED , EVEN AS I LOOKED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000087.wav|4|HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET ON MY NERVES , AND THE FEEL OF THE ROOM WAS BAD ENOUGH , WITHOUT MAKING IT ANY NASTIER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000523.wav|4|THE RING HAD BEEN LOST SO LONG , THAT IT HAD BECOME ALMOST A MYTH AND IT WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY TO STAND THERE , WITH THE ACTUAL THING IN MY HAND , AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001244.wav|4|WHEN WE GOT DOWNSTAIRS , TASSOC PASSED THE BOTTLE ROUND .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001058.wav|2|BUT AS HE DID SO , IT SEEMED ALL THE THINGS HE DREADED WOULD HAPPEN WERE BREATHING DOWN HIS BACK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001100.wav|2|GUYS WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ? GET THIS NUT WITH THE BLASTER OFFA ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002307.wav|4|YET , THE SHAPES WERE SUFFICIENTLY INDEFINITE TO MAKE ME CAREFUL NOT TO LET MYSELF BE OVERIMPRESSED BY THE UNCOMFORTABLE RESEMBLANCE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000891.wav|4|THEN A SUDDEN POWER OF MOVEMENT CAME TO ME . I RAISED MY CAMERA , WITH THE FLASHLIGHT FIXED , AND SNAPPED IT AT THE DOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001100.wav|4|A PICTURE OF THE FINE WIRE WITH WHICH THEY WERE GRAPPLING FOR THE HOOK THAT HELD THE ENTRANCE DOOR OPEN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000274.wav|1|ARE YOU ARE YOU FOND OF DOGS ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001308.wav|4|LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER , AND LISTENING FOR THE THING THAT I EXPECTED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000900.wav|4|HE WAS LOOKING AT ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002289.wav|4|SO THAT THE WHOLE CHANCEL HAD BEEN , AS IT WERE , UNDER OBSERVATION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000132.wav|4|I WAS WAKED SUDDENLY FROM A DEEP SLEEP BY A LOUD CRASH SOMEWHERE OUT IN THE PASSAGE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001913.wav|4|THE OLD BUTLER BEING NEARLY STABBED TO DEATH ONE NIGHT IN THE CHAPEL , WITH A PECULIAR OLD DAGGER .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000441.wav|2|DROP THAT STUFF !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000283.wav|1|AND MAKING QUITE A COMMOTION IN THE POOL AS IT WENT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002385.wav|4|AS I BENT THE MOVABLE PORTION LOWER THERE CAME A QUICK CLICK AND A SECTION OF THE FLOOR SLID TO ONE SIDE , SHOWING A LONG , SHALLOW CAVITY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000340.wav|1|THE MOUSE MADE NO OBJECTION TO THIS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001359.wav|4|SOUNDING ALL THE WAY BUT I FOUND NOTHING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000492.wav|4|PETER CAME , PRESENTLY , WITH THE COFFEE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000496.wav|4|AND AFTER I HAD LOCKED MY DOOR I TURNED IN PROPERLY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001858.wav|4|OF COURSE , THE WATER WAS THE SAME HEIGHT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WALLS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001968.wav|4|BUT HE COULD TELL ME NOTHING THAT DID NOT POINT TO THERE BEING A POWER ABROAD IN THE CHAPEL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001377.wav|4|I TELL YOU , IT WAS AS EXTRAORDINARY AS IT WAS HORRIBLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000407.wav|4|MY POWER OF SIGHT CAME GRADUALLY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000566.wav|2|HE SHUT THE THING OFF AGAIN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001898.wav|4|A MINUTE OR SO LATER CARNACKI BEGAN TO SPEAK ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002047.wav|4|AT THE END OF THE TWO HOURS I WENT FOR MY KEY AND FOUND IT READY , MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001353.wav|4|I REMOVED THE OTHER HAIRS , AND THE SEALS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000483.wav|2|READY TO HOOT AT THE STARS , EVEN , IF THEY FOUND NO BETTER DIVERSION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000541.wav|4|WHEN HE HAD GONE DOWNSTAIRS , I LET MYSELF INTO THE ROOM , AND LOCKED AND SEALED THE DOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000485.wav|2|FOR SPITE , MAYBE . OR JUST FOR THE LID-BLOWING HELL OF IT AS A REACTION AGAINST THE AWFUL CONFINEMENT OF BEING OUT HERE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001201.wav|4|YOU KNOW !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000360.wav|4|WITH A FRESH , NEW SENSE OF IMPENDING DANGER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000218.wav|4|WHICH NOW SEEMED RIDICULOUSLY DIM BY CONTRAST WITH THE TREMENDOUS BLAZE OF THE FLASH-POWER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000811.wav|4|AND ONE IN EACH CORNER OF THE BIG ROOM AND THEN I LIT THE FIRE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000586.wav|2|NIGHT AFTER NIGHT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000808.wav|2|BRISTLY FACES SHOWED SWIFT CHANGES OF EXPRESSION SURPRISE , INTEREST ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000037.wav|4|FROM HIM I LEARNED MORE PARTICULARS REGARDING TWO THINGS THAT ANDERSON HAD MENTIONED IN BUT A CASUAL MANNER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000240.wav|2|THERE CAN BE NO HEAT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000563.wav|4|IT WAS BLOWING UP FROM THE FLOOR CLOSE TO ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000547.wav|2|THE GLAZED PLAQUE ON THE WALL , WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN A RELIGIOUS EMBLEM , A CALENDAR OF SOME KIND , A DECORATION , OR SOMETHING BEYOND HUMAN IMAGINING ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000845.wav|4|I TOOK A LAST LOOK ROUND THE GREAT HALL , AND SAW THAT THE TWO BIG HOUNDS WERE LYING QUIETLY , WITH THEIR NOSES BETWEEN THEIR PAWS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000059.wav|1|AND ALICE'S FIRST IDEA WAS THAT IT MIGHT BELONG TO ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HALL ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000353.wav|4|AND STILL THAT WIND BLEW UPON ME AND THEN , SUDDENLY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000240.wav|1|AND SO HAVE I BEEN , EVER SINCE I CAME DOWN HERE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002276.wav|4|I RETURNED TO MY ROOM , WASHED , SHAVED AND DRESSED , AFTER WHICH I READ AWHILE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001869.wav|4|THERE ARE , SAID CARNACKI AND STOOD UP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000099.wav|4|I SIMPLY COULD NOT BUNK OUT , WITH THE BUTLER STANDING THERE , AFTER HAVING , AS IT WERE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000655.wav|1|YOU ARE OLD , SAID THE YOUTH , AS I MENTIONED BEFORE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000080.wav|2|WAS MADDENING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000401.wav|1|AND A CANARY CALLED OUT IN A TREMBLING VOICE TO ITS CHILDREN COME AWAY FROM HER , MY DEARS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000565.wav|1|AND FEEBLY STRETCHING OUT ONE PAW ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000283.wav|2|BUBS' FANCY WAS VIVID , TOO .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000300.wav|4|AND WOULD NOT COME INSIDE , DIED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000425.wav|1|AND AT ONCE SAID IN A QUICK ANGRY TONE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001175.wav|4|I GUESS SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE HARD HIT , UNLESS I LOSE WHICH I DON'T MEAN TO .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000493.wav|4|AND WHEN I HAD DRUNK IT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000570.wav|4|AND THEN , ABRUPTLY , I KNEW THAT THE WIND WAS BLOWING UP AT ME FROM THE RING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001233.wav|4|THERE CAME AN EXTRAORDINARY YELLING SCREAM INTO THE HIDEOUS WHISTLING ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000510.wav|4|BUT WITHOUT THE MOUNTS , WHICH FORM THE POINTS OF THE DEFENSIVE STAR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000258.wav|4|AND HE LOOKED AT ME , NODDING HIS HEAD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000527.wav|4|YOU SEE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000611.wav|4|WAS NO MORE THAN A LITTLE SOLID SPLASH OF HOT METAL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000268.wav|1|CRIED POOR ALICE AGAIN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000432.wav|4|I SAW WHAT HAD SO NEARLY GIVEN THE MONSTER AN OPENING THROUGH THE BARRIER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000466.wav|2|FOURTH OF JULY ! HALLOWE'EN , DUTCH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002085.wav|4|ABOVE THE ALTAR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002154.wav|4|AS CAN BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000671.wav|2|HE DOESN'T LOSE SLEEP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000270.wav|1|HAVE I OFFENDED YOU ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000448.wav|4|INSTINCTIVELY , I STARTED SIDEWAYS FROM IT , AND SO PLUCKED MY HAND FROM UPON THE ELECTRIC PENTACLE , WHERE FOR A WICKEDLY CARELESS MOMENT I HAD PLACED IT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000009.wav|4|REMARKING THAT I HAD BEEN BUYING A NEW GUN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000290.wav|1|AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS I HATE CATS AND DOGS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001001.wav|4|I THOUGHT INSTANTLY , WITH A SICK APPREHENSION , OF OUR OWN BARRIERS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001218.wav|4|AS THE DOOR FLEW OPEN , THE SOUND BEAT OUT AT US ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001328.wav|4|ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK I WAS WAKED BY THE HOONING WHISTLING OF THE ROOM COMING TO ME ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000778.wav|2|ROSE FLUNG AFTER HIM BY HELMET PHONE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001909.wav|4|IT SOUNDS ALMOST LAUGHABLE , I KNOW , TO HEAR OF A LONG-RESPECTED SUPERNATURAL PHENOMENON GROWING UNEXPECTEDLY DANGEROUS AND IN THIS CASE , THE TALE OF THE HAUNTING WAS CONSIDERED AS LITTLE MORE THAN AN OLD MYTH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000420.wav|1|AND SHE BEGAN HUNTING FOR THEM ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002160.wav|4|OF THE VOID .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000122.wav|2|ALL SPACE WAS STILL ELECTRIFIED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000778.wav|1|OF COURSE , THE MOCK TURTLE SAID ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000203.wav|4|AND THERE WOULD BE , POSSIBLY , A VERY QUEER PICTURE TO EXAMINE IN THE MORNING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000509.wav|1|SOUND OF MORE BREAKING GLASS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000417.wav|4|APPEARING TO GATHER FORM AND SOLIDITY AS IT CAME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001240.wav|4|AND THERE WE STOOD A MOMENT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002172.wav|4|BUT NOW I PULLED OUT MY REVOLVER , AND THEN , WITH A TREMENDOUS EFFORT OF WILL , SWITCHED OFF THE LIGHT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000472.wav|1|AND NOW HERE I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000238.wav|2|YES THE MOTION OF THE FEW SCATTERED MOLECULES IN SPACE WAS VERY FAST INDICATING A HIGH TEMPERATURE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001363.wav|4|I WENT EVEN FURTHER , THEN FOR AT NIGHT , WHEN THE WHISTLING COMMENCED , I MADE A MICROPHONE TEST .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000405.wav|1|SHE SAT FOR SOME WHILE SORROWFUL AND SILENT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000056.wav|2|WHEN THE TURNIPS GET YOU DOWN !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000161.wav|1|AFTER A TIME , SHE HEARD A LITTLE PATTERING OF FEET IN THE DISTANCE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000186.wav|2|IT WAS NOT ROUND ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000593.wav|4|I LOCKED IT , AND GOT TO MY ROOM SOMEHOW FOR I WAS TREMBLING SO THAT I COULD HARDLY STAND , AS YOU CAN IMAGINE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000488.wav|2|BUT MAYBE THIS WAY IS MORE FUN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000256.wav|1|I QUITE FORGOT YOU DIDN'T LIKE CATS !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000442.wav|2|AT THAT MOMENT THE SUN'S RIM APPEARED AT THE LANDSCAPE'S JAGGED EDGE , AND ON THIS SIDE OF AIRLESS VESTA COMPLETE NIGHT WAS TRANSFORMED TO COMPLETE DAY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000411.wav|2|A RUSTLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002012.wav|4|FOR THE BUTLER , AS YOU KNOW , WAS STRUCK IN FULL SIGHT OF THE RECTOR , SIR JARNOCK AND HIS SON .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000166.wav|4|I'VE LAIN AWAKE ALL NIGHT , WITH THE SOUND OF THE DOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000496.wav|1|THAT YOU WO'N'T !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000231.wav|4|EVEN AS I DID SO , I THOUGHT I HEARD A SOUND IN THE PASSAGE , AND QUITE NEAR ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000951.wav|2|WHERE WAS THERE TO TURN , WITH GRIM , UNANSWERING BLANKNESS ON EVERY SIDE ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000085.wav|4|HE APOLOGIZED BUT MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT I DID NOT REALIZE THE DANGER OF THE ROOM AND I COULD SEE , GENERALLY , THAT HE WAS IN A PRETTY FRIGHTENED STATE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001054.wav|4|FOR SOME PURPOSE OF THEIR OWN AND NOW THAT WENTWORTH WAS ATTEMPTING TO TAKE POSSESSION , THEY WERE ACTING UP THE TRADITIONS OF THE PLACE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000458.wav|4|AND SEEMED TO LEAP ALMOST INTO MY FACE
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000617.wav|2|BUT HE WAS WISHING DESPERATELY THAT HE COULD WIN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001999.wav|4|AS YOU KNOW , HOWEVER , AT THIS POINT OF MY INVESTIGATION , I WAS STILL AT THAT STAGE WHERE I CONSIDERED THE EXISTENCE OF A SUPERNATURAL FORCE UNPROVEN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002412.wav|4|I LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN , BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD NOT YET REACHED OUT TO ANY CONCLUSION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000351.wav|4|AND WITH NO LIGHT BEYOND THE WEAKISH BLUE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC PENTACLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000891.wav|2|SACKING AND DESTROYING IN SHEER EXUBERANCE , LIKE BRATS ON HALLOWE'EN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000304.wav|4|AS I'VE JUST SAID , IN THAT HORRIBLE BLACK VEIL BUSINESS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001870.wav|4|OUT YOU GO , HE SAID , GENIALLY , USING THE RECOGNIZED FORMULA .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000608.wav|4|I CARRIED THE THINGS INTO THE GREY ROOM , AND THERE , IN THE CENTER OF THE ELECTRIC PENTACLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000089.wav|4|WERE ANYONE TO VENTURE INTO THE ROOM IN THE DARK WITH THE INTENTION OF PLAYING THE FOOL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000968.wav|4|I GRIPPED AT MY CAMERA AND FLASHLIGHT , AND WAITED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000278.wav|2|AS HE TORE THE PINCHBAR , WHICH HAD BEEN CONVENIENTLY ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE BOX , FREE OF ITS STAPLES , AND PROCEEDED TO BREAK OUT SUPPLIES , THEIR WHIMSICAL MUSINGS FELL CLOSE TO WHAT HE WAS THINKING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001124.wav|2|DON'T LET US DOWN , NEELY !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001901.wav|4|WITHOUT REMOVING HIS GAZE FROM THE FIRE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000333.wav|1|AND THE DUCK QUACKED A COMFORTABLE LAUGH TO ITSELF .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000219.wav|2|IT HAD ODD , TRIANGULAR WINDOWS , WHICH MAY ONCE HAVE BEEN GLAZED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002010.wav|4|EVEN HAD I DISCOVERED SOME OTHER OPENING , SECRET OR OTHERWISE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000804.wav|1|MY OWN , MY GENTLE SALMON !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000117.wav|2|THEY WERE ITCHING TO BE ASSAULTED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002223.wav|4|IF I HAD GIVEN WAY THEN TO THAT , I SHOULD SIMPLY HAVE BUNKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PLACE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001461.wav|4|HER FACE WAS TURNED A LITTLE UPWARD AS IF SHE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED SUDDENLY BY SOME NOISE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000113.wav|2|NO .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000988.wav|2|BUT THEY WERE COOL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000169.wav|2|WHAT DO WE DO , JOHNNY ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000486.wav|4|TO ENTICE ME FROM THE PENTACLES .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001298.wav|4|THEN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000580.wav|4|YET IT ELUDED ME , AS THOUGH SOME INVISIBLE , LIVING THING JERKED IT HITHER AND THITHER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000196.wav|1|I'LL TRY AND SAY HOW DOTH THE LITTLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000587.wav|1|I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TEACHING IT TRICKS , IF IF I'D ONLY BEEN THE RIGHT SIZE TO DO IT !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002078.wav|4|YET , I HAD GOT TO GO THROUGH WITH THE BUSINESS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000683.wav|2|SURE . TO MR . MAHONEY , THE BOSS AT THE MINING CAMP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000869.wav|2|WITH A SUDDEN LUNGE NEELY GRIPPED ENDLICH'S HAND , AND GAVE IT A SAVAGE IF MOMENTARY TWIST THAT SENT NEEDLES OF PAIN SHOOTING UP THE HOMESTEADER'S ARM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000334.wav|4|I HAD NO DOUBT THAT I WAS INVESTIGATING A DANGEROUS AND UGLY CASE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000323.wav|4|THEN ROUND AT THE BIG , EMPTY ROOM , OVER THE DOUBLE BARRIER OF ELECTRIC AND CANDLE LIGHT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000342.wav|4|THEN I HOVE MYSELF ROUND WITH A SORT OF STIFF JERK , AND STARED STRAIGHT AGAINST THAT QUEER WIND .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000006.wav|2|BUT BEYOND THIS POINT THE SITUATION WAS BITTER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002284.wav|4|AND AS SOON AS I WAS READY I SET TO WORK TO DEVELOP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002395.wav|4|I WITHDREW THE LEVER AND THE NARROW STRIP OF FLOOR SLID BACK , COVERING POST AND DAGGER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000963.wav|4|I FELT ALL AT ONCE TO BE GIVEN A POWER OF HEARING THAT WAS FAR BEYOND THE NORMAL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000406.wav|2|HE COULD ONLY WAIT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000814.wav|2|TEETH BIT . JUICE SQUIRTED ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001111.wav|4|BUT FATE JUST ORDERED IT THE OTHER WAY .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000854.wav|1|WAKE UP ! ALICE DEAR ! SAID HER SISTER , WHAT A NICE LONG SLEEP YOU'VE HAD !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000844.wav|1|NONSENSE ! CRIED ALICE , SO LOUDLY THAT EVERYBODY JUMPED ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001038.wav|4|I WALKED HARD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000005.wav|1|SO SHE WAS CONSIDERING IN HER OWN MIND ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001265.wav|4|IT WAS EMPTY , AND I WENT THROUGH THE DOORWAY , AND PUSHED-TO THE OAK BEHIND ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000294.wav|1|AND SEVERAL OTHER CURIOUS CREATURES .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001155.wav|4|AND SO FAR AS I CAN SEE , I'VE JUST STUCK MY HEAD INTO AN IRISH HORNET'S NEST .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000161.wav|4|THE OLD MAN GAVE A START , AND SLOPPED SOME OF THE COFFEE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000986.wav|4|AND A SENSE OF A VERY REAL AND PRESENT DANGER IMMINENT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000505.wav|2|THE HARSHNESS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000881.wav|2|WHAT ELSE YOU GOT BESIDES TAMADAS ? LET'S GO ON A PICNIC .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000243.wav|1|I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE , OH MOUSE !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000277.wav|1|A LITTLE BRIGHT-EYED TERRIER , YOU KNOW , WITH OH ! SUCH LONG CURLY BROWN HAIR !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001164.wav|4|AND THEN SHE ASKED ME WHETHER I WASN'T AFRAID OF THE WHISTLING ROOM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001696.wav|4|I SAT UP IN BED , AND LISTENED ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000865.wav|4|AND THE FEELING OF MYSTERY !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000538.wav|1|AND THEN ANOTHER CONFUSION OF VOICES ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000434.wav|1|BUT OF COURSE , THOUGHT ALICE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000620.wav|4|OLD PETER NEARLY FAINTED WHEN HE KNEW THAT I MEANT TO BUT BY THE THIRD NIGHT HE SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT THE HOUSE WAS JUST SAFE AND ORDINARY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000474.wav|2|ALMOST SOFTLY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000535.wav|2|A TENTACLE !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002058.wav|4|I BUCKLED ON THE PLATE ARMOR , AND FOUND IT EXTRAORDINARILY UNCOMFORTABLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000459.wav|4|SO NEARLY DID IT APPROACH BUT FOR THE THIRD TIME IT WAS THROWN BACK BY SOME ALTOGETHER ENORMOUS , OVERMASTERING FORCE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000713.wav|2|AND HAD HELPED SUPPLY THE GREENHOUSE WITH ATMOSPHERE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000884.wav|2|I'M NOT GOIN' ON SHIFT . COME ON , EVERYBODY ! THERE'S GONNA BE A FIGHT A MOIDER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001868.wav|4|THERE MAY BE OTHER HOUSES I BEGAN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000873.wav|1|THEN SHE THOUGHT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000773.wav|4|THE PLACE WAS SMOTHERED WITH THEM SO THAT THE HOUSE SEEMED TO BE GROWING UP OUT OF A SEA OF GREEN LAUREL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000852.wav|2|ENDLICH TRIED FOR PEACE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000446.wav|4|A MINUTE AFTERWARD , THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND SLAMMED TWICE WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000185.wav|2|LATER , HE HAD OF COURSE SEEN IT FROM SPACE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000412.wav|2|IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE BY HEAVY SPACE-BOOTS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000725.wav|4|IT WAS A QUIET NIGHT , SO THIS DID NOT MATTER , FOR THE LIGHTS KEPT STEADY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001877.wav|4|AND BY WHICH I WAS REQUESTED TO PRESENT MYSELF AT HIS HOUSE NOT LATER THAN SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THAT EVENING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002260.wav|4|IT WAS AS IF I WERE SUBCONSCIOUSLY SURPRISED THAT IT LAY QUIET IN MY HANDS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002088.wav|4|FOR WHAT I WAS DOING NEEDED NO ADDITION OF UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHTS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000121.wav|4|POOR OLD BEGGAR !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001214.wav|2|ENDLICH WAS RECONCILED TO DOMESTICITY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000962.wav|2|BUT THE QUESTION ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002080.wav|4|FIRST OF ALL I SWITCHED ON MY LIGHT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001164.wav|2|HERE , THE TRACES GOT KICKED OVER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000284.wav|2|LOOK , POP !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000399.wav|2|IT'S NOTHING , BUBS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000011.wav|4|AND A SMILE WHICH I THINK SHOWED A GENUINELY GOOD-HUMORED APPRECIATION OF MY INTENTIONAL CHANGING OF THE CONVERSATION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000556.wav|2|AND ALSO WITH THE GLOBES OVERHEAD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000801.wav|4|I SET TWO OF THEM TO LAY A FIRE IN THE BIG GRATE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000857.wav|4|THERE WAS NO TALKING , EXCEPT THAT , ONCE OR TWICE , THE POLICE BENT TOWARD ONE ANOTHER , AND WHISPERED ODD REMARKS CONCERNING THE HALL ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000047.wav|1|AND THE WHITE RABBIT WAS STILL IN SIGHT , HURRYING DOWN IT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001127.wav|4|AT THE END , WE TOOK OUR WINE AND CIGARS TO OUR USUAL POSITIONS , AND CARNACKI HAVING GOT HIMSELF COMFORTABLE IN HIS BIG CHAIR BEGAN WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY I HAVE JUST GOT BACK FROM IRELAND , AGAIN , HE SAID . AND I THOUGHT YOU CHAPS WOULD BE INTERESTED TO HEAR MY NEWS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000149.wav|1|AND HURRIED OFF TO THE GARDEN DOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002278.wav|4|HALF AN HOUR LATER I WAS HEADING FOR BURTONTREE , AS HARD AS I COULD WALK FOR A SUDDEN IDEA HAD COME TO ME , WHICH I WAS ANXIOUS TO TEST .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000163.wav|1|IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT COMING BACK AGAIN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000208.wav|2|BUBS TURNED AROUND .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002005.wav|4|AND ALSO THAT THE ONLY WAY OF INGRESS AND EGRESS TO AND FROM THE CHAPEL IS THROUGH THE DOORWAY WHICH LEADS INTO THE CASTLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002271.wav|4|AFTER WHICH I WENT DOWN THE QUIET AISLE AT A PRETTY QUICK WALK ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002164.wav|4|AND WITH A SUDDEN , JERKY MOVEMENT , I SWITCHED ON THE LIGHT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000603.wav|2|YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY . AND TONIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO SLEEP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000268.wav|4|TELLING PETER I SHOULD NOT BE DOWN FOR DINNER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000670.wav|2|HE GROANED , ALMOST TOO WEARY EVEN TO SWALLOW HIS FOOD , IN SPITE OF THE LUXURY OF A REAL , PULLMAN-STYLE SUPPER TABLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000140.wav|1|LET ME SEE I'LL GIVE THEM A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS EVERY CHRISTMAS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000086.wav|2|THE KIDS HAD KEPT ON BAWLING MORE AND MORE VIOLENTLY . BUT NOW THEY GOT DOWN TO VERBAL EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THE MATTER
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000951.wav|4|HE LOOKED VERY PALE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000478.wav|1|THAT'LL BE A COMFORT , ONE WAY NEVER TO BE AN OLD WOMAN BUT THEN ALWAYS TO HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000477.wav|2|EVEN YOU GOT MORE SENSE THAN THAT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000863.wav|2|HEAR WHAT PUN'KINS SAYS ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000655.wav|4|WHICH WAS NATURAL ENOUGH IN A LITTLE PLACE LIKE KORUNTON .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000309.wav|4|WHEN THEY SURROUNDED THE MEDIUM WITH A CURRENT , IN VACUUM ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000359.wav|2|FOR A LONG MOMENT , ENDLICH WAS IN AN AGONY OF INDECISION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000385.wav|2|ONCE , HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A GRUNT , OR A MALICIOUS CHUCKLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000006.wav|4|YOU'VE NOT BEEN LONG AWAY , THIS TIME , I REMARKED , AS I FINISHED MY SOUP FORGETTING MOMENTARILY CARNACKI'S DISLIKE OF BEING ASKED EVEN TO SKIRT THE BORDERS OF HIS STORY UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE WAS READY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000040.wav|1|AND WAS SAYING TO HER VERY EARNESTLY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000367.wav|1|SAID THE MOUSE TO ALICE SEVERELY , WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001375.wav|4|IT WAS AS IF AN INTELLIGENCE THERE KNEW THAT STEPS WERE BEING TAKEN AGAINST IT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000051.wav|2|BUT NOW , AT THE FINAL MOMENT OF BLEAK ANTICLIMAX , THEY TOOK THEIR REVENGE IN GUFFAWS AND RIDICULE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000783.wav|4|BUT IN THE SOMEWHAT BRIEF AND GENERAL SEARCH , I FOUND NOTHING AND DECIDED TO BEGIN MY USUAL EXACT EXAMINATION OF EVERY SQUARE FOOT OF THE PLACE NOT ONLY OF THE HALL , IN THIS CASE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000475.wav|1|AT LEAST THERE'S NO ROOM TO GROW UP ANY MORE HERE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001189.wav|2|THAT , AMID THE RAUCOUS LAUGHTER OF HIS COMPANIONS , WHICH STILL SOUNDED SLIGHTLY SELF-CONSCIOUS AND PITYING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000590.wav|4|THE MONSTER WAS CHAINED , AS SURELY AS ANY BEAST WOULD BE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000506.wav|4|AT THE SECOND GO , I GOT IT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000154.wav|4|BUT , ALL THE SAME , I ALWAYS FEEL MEAN AND MISERABLE , AFTER A TIME LIKE THAT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002069.wav|4|IT FITTED PERFECTLY AND A MOMENT LATER I WAS IN THE CHAPEL , WITH THE DOOR LOCKED BEHIND ME ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002360.wav|4|HE STEPPED TO THE LEFT WHILST I TOOK THE DUMMY IN MY ARMS AND TURNED IT TO FACE THE ALTAR , SO THAT IT STOOD CLOSE TO THE GATE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000335.wav|2|AGAIN , FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS THEY HAD RECEIVED , THE ENDLICHS UNCRATED AND SET UP AN ATOM-DRIVEN DRILL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000003.wav|1|BUT IT HAD NO PICTURES OR CONVERSATIONS IN IT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000504.wav|4|I DID SO , AND HEARD MY WIRE RING ON METAL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002179.wav|4|THIS JUST ABOUT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLETELY HUMAN ILLOGICALNESS OF THE WORKINGS OF MY FEELINGS FOR , AS YOU KNOW , WHATEVER CREATURE , THING , OR BEING IT WAS THAT HAD MADE THAT EXTRAORDINARY AND HORRIBLE ATTACK ON THE OLD BUTLER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000526.wav|2|YET FROM THE START IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT , WITH INSUFFICIENT ELECTRIC POWER , THE PROCESS WAS TOO SLOW .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001971.wav|4|THAT I HAD LEARNED FROM THE OTHERS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000465.wav|4|I KNEW BY THIS MORE OF THE EXTENT AND CLOSENESS OF THE DANGER AND FOR A LONG TIME I WAS SIMPLY COWED BY THE BUTT-HEADED BRUTALITY OF THAT FORCE UPON MY SPIRIT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000422.wav|1|AND HER WALK ALONG THE RIVER-BANK WITH ITS FRINGE OF RUSHES AND FORGET-ME-NOTS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002407.wav|4|THERE'S THE INVISIBLE THING THAT USED THE DAGGER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001134.wav|2|UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS HUMAN NATURE CAN BE PRETTY FICKLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000561.wav|2|BUT THEY COULD NOT BE TOO UNFAMILIAR . AND ITS PRESENCE WAS LOGICAL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000678.wav|2|SHE ANSWERED , RATHER DEFENSIVELY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001864.wav|4|IF I CAN USE THE WORD IN THAT WAY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000734.wav|2|IF HE EVER HAD TIME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000480.wav|4|THE DAWN CAME SLOWLY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000205.wav|1|SAID POOR ALICE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002219.wav|4|AND MY HEAD APPEARED TO TIGHTEN , AS IF ALL THE SCALP HAD GROWN TENSE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000302.wav|4|IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000416.wav|2|THEN IT BURNED PEACEFULLY AGAIN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000636.wav|4|AND , AS I KNOW , LOOKING VERY DESOLATE AND LONESOME GENERALLY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000234.wav|4|I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000448.wav|2|ENDLICH KNEW THAT NEELY KNEW THAT HE WAS AFRAID FOR HIS WIFE , AND WOULDN'T START ANYTHING UNLESS DRIVEN AND GOADED SHEERLY WILD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000870.wav|1|SO THE BOAT WOUND SLOWLY ALONG ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000085.wav|2|THEN CAME THE LAST STRAW .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002272.wav|4|AND SO GOT OUT OF THE PLACE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000525.wav|4|SUPPOSING THAT IT WERE , IN A WAY , A DOORWAY YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN ? A SORT OF GAP IN THE WORLD-HEDGE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000108.wav|4|NEAR THE DOOR , I HAD A SUDDEN FEELING THAT THERE WAS A COLD WIND IN THE ROOM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002046.wav|4|TELLING HIM I WOULD CALL NEXT DAY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000059.wav|2|OUGHT TO HAVE A MAN-SIZE FELLA .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000490.wav|1|AND SHE TREMBLED TILL SHE SHOOK THE HOUSE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001227.wav|4|AND LOOKED QUICKLY ROUND .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000529.wav|2|AND TO KEEP THE PLACE WARM . AND TO BRING NITROGEN GAS UP OUT OF THE SOIL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000553.wav|1|THEY ALL MADE A RUSH AT HER THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000562.wav|4|THE WIND MET ME IN THE FACE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000742.wav|2|ROSE HAD TO TEACH THE KIDS THEIR REGULAR LESSONS .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000368.wav|4|AND THERE WAS A MOST INTENSE SILENCE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000487.wav|1|SAID THE VOICE , FETCH ME MY GLOVES THIS MOMENT !

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000741.wav|4|THEN WENTWORTH WENT OUT FROM THE MEN A LITTLE , AND AIMED HIS GUN AT THE DOORWAY .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002397.wav|4|THEN I SHUT THE CHANCEL GATE ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000627.wav|2|BUT METEORS , THOUGH PLENTIFUL IN THE ASTEROID BELT , WERE CURIOUSLY INNOCUOUS .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000886.wav|4|I HAD A CERTAINTY OF SOMETHING IMPENDING AS IT MIGHT BE THE IMPRESSION OF AN INVISIBLE , BUT OVERWHELMING , PRESENCE .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001027.wav|4|LATER , HOWEVER , I WENT UP TO MY ROOM , AND PROCEEDED WITH MY PHOTOGRAPHY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000749.wav|2|AND IT WAS THE KIDS WHO FOUND THE FIRST TAY-TAY BUG ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000322.wav|2|BOARDS WERE JERKED LOOSE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000799.wav|4|I WAS GOING TO RUN NO RISK OF BEING DECEIVED BY GHOSTLY HALLUCINATION , OR MESMERIC INFLUENCE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002277.wav|4|THEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND GOT THE ACTING BUTLER TO GIVE ME SOME SANDWICHES AND A CUP OF COFFEE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000496.wav|2|ROSE AND THE KIDS WERE CROUCHED IN THE DEFLATED TENT . BUT RETURNING THERE , JOHN ENDLICH HARDLY SAW THEM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000560.wav|2|ITS SECRETS WERE HIDDEN WITHIN IT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000763.wav|4|THE DOG LET OUT A GREAT , MOURNFUL HOWL ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001882.wav|4|NOT ONE OF US EVER WILLINGLY MISSED , FOR AFTER A THOROUGHLY SENSIBLE LITTLE DINNER CARNACKI WOULD SNUGGLE DOWN INTO HIS BIG ARMCHAIR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000938.wav|4|AND I KNEW THAT THEY WERE GETTING THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000804.wav|2|THEN , WITH CALM AND FOOLHARDY DETACHMENT , HE SET THE SIX TOMATOES OUT IN A ROW BEFORE HIM ON THE SYNTHETIC MAHOGANY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000241.wav|2|AND SO FEW MOLECULES WERE THERE IN THE VOID ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000510.wav|2|FIRST HE SCRAMBLED AND LEAPED AROUND , COLLECTING HIS SCATTERED AND DAMAGED GEAR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000400.wav|2|HE GROWLED . NOTHING BUT THE BLASTING IN THE MINES .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002155.wav|4|MY REASON WAS BOUND TO SUBMIT SOMEWHAT TO MY FANCY AT SUCH A TIME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002079.wav|4|AND I JUST TOOK HOLD OF MY LITTLE BIT OF COURAGE AND SET TO WORK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001228.wav|4|TASSOC AND HIS BROTHER JOINED ME , AND THE MAN CAME UP AT THE BACK , AND WE ALL HELD OUR CANDLES HIGH .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002106.wav|4|AS I HAD NOTICED DURING MY SEARCH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000849.wav|4|FOR THE REST , THERE WAS TO BE NO SHOOTING , UNLESS I GAVE THE WORD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001857.wav|4|AND SO CLIMB INTO THE PASSAGE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000768.wav|2|A THING TO RELEASE PENT-UP FORCES IN MEN WHO HAD SEEN TOO MANY HARD STARS , AND HAD HEARD TOO MUCH STILLNESS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000544.wav|1|SAID THE VOICE OF THE RABBIT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000587.wav|4|THE HAND WAS PLUNGING TOWARD ME YET , EVEN AS IT HAD BEEN UNABLE TO PASS INTO THE PENTACLE WHEN THE RING WAS WITHOUT ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000717.wav|4|BUT , FOR ALL THAT , HE WENT AND I MUST ADMIRE HIS PLUCK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000233.wav|2|ALMOST INSTANTLY , THE SKY , WHICH HAD BEEN DEEP BLUE BEFORE , MUST HAVE TURNED TO ITS PRESENT BLACK , WITH THE VOIDAL STARS BLAZING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001299.wav|4|JUST AS I WAS MAKING AN END ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001158.wav|4|THEY FEEL RAW AGAINST ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000630.wav|1|WHY ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000156.wav|2|RUB WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU IN THE DUST OF YOUR CLAIM !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000214.wav|4|AND MY HANDS BEGAN TO SWEAT A LITTLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000333.wav|2|EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT IT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000040.wav|4|AND THIS EVEN THOUGH THE BUTLER KNEW IT WAS LOCKED ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000667.wav|1|NOT QUITE RIGHT , I'M AFRAID , SAID ALICE TIMIDLY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000591.wav|1|BUT THE GREAT QUESTION IS WHAT ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000272.wav|4|IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT I INTENDED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000017.wav|1|I MUST BE GETTING SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000853.wav|4|THEN I ARRANGED MY CAMERA AND FLASHLIGHT HANDY , AND EXAMINED MY REVOLVER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001018.wav|2|BUT HE FORCED HIS TONE TO BE CONVERSATIONAL WHEN HE SPOKE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002024.wav|4|AND THAT HE COULD NOT ALLOW ME TO ATTEMPT SUCH A THING AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE BUTLER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000522.wav|4|SINCE THEN , AS YOU MAY IMAGINE , NO ONE HAS EVER SPENT A NIGHT IN THE GREY ROOM , UNTIL I DID SO .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000168.wav|2|WHEN , AFTER A MOMENT , ROSE SPOKE QUAVERINGLY , HE WAS ALMOST GRATEFUL
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001141.wav|2|SWEAT STREAMING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000039.wav|4|AND SLAM HEAVILY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000622.wav|4|CARNACKI STOOD UP AND BEGAN TO SHAKE HANDS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002006.wav|4|THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS ALWAYS KEPT LOCKED ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000668.wav|4|A WHOLE CROWD OF THE VILLAGERS ASSEMBLED TO SEE HIM OFF FOR BY THIS TIME THEY ALL KNEW OF HIS INTENTION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001020.wav|4|I CAUGHT WENTWORTH AND THE POLICE AT THE LODGE GATE .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002141.wav|4|I SHOULD HAVE DONE A THING MUCH MORE WORTHY OF MENTION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001198.wav|2|HE QUESTIONED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000609.wav|1|WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000062.wav|4|I TOOK A COUPLE OF CANDLES , AND PETER FOLLOWED WITH HIS BUNCH OF KEYS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000482.wav|4|AND MADE THE PALE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC PENTACLE LOOK MORE UNEARTHLY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000378.wav|1|BUT YOU'RE SO EASILY OFFENDED , YOU KNOW .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001443.wav|4|THAT IS WHAT I KEPT THINKING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000264.wav|1|AS SHE SWAM LAZILY ABOUT IN THE POOL ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000787.wav|4|AND THE KEEPING OF A PERFECTLY OPEN MIND .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001174.wav|2|SOMEBODY GUFFAWED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001929.wav|4|AFTER THE ATTACK ON THE BUTLER , IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST SOMETHING IN THE OLD STORY CONCERNING THE DAGGER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001879.wav|4|BEEN AWAY IN KENT FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS BUT BEYOND THAT , WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000561.wav|4|AND I WHIPPED ROUND , WITH A HIDEOUS QUAKE OF FEAR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001884.wav|4|AND WAIT WHILST WE ARRANGED OURSELVES COMFORTABLY IN OUR ACCUSTOMED SEATS AND NOOKS .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000552.wav|4|ALSO , I HAD A FEELING THAT THERE WOULD BE A VAST EFFORT MADE THAT NIGHT TO REGAIN THE USE OF THE RING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000688_S0000114.wav|3|ON THE CONTRARY SURRENDER YOUR VERY SELVES TO GOD AS LIVING MEN WHO HAVE RISEN FROM THE DEAD ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000127.wav|1|AND LAID HER HAND ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD TO FEEL WHICH WAY IT WAS GROWING ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001453.wav|4|HE WOULD TELL US ALL ABOUT IT LATER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001899.wav|4|IGNORING ANY PRELIMINARY REMARKS , AND GOING STRAIGHT TO THE SUBJECT OF THE STORY WE KNEW HE HAD TO TELL
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001188.wav|4|IT WAS A SORT OF TUNE , IN A WAY BUT MORE AS IF A DEVIL OR SOME ROTTEN THING WERE LAUGHING AT YOU ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000123.wav|4|ABOUT MIDNIGHT , I WENT TO BED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000396.wav|4|I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO LEARN DEFINITELY WHETHER WHATEVER WAS ABROAD WAS DANGEROUS TO LIFE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000806.wav|2|BLOODSHOT EYES , SOME OF THEM BELONGING TO MEN WHO HAD BEEN AS GENTLE AS LAMBS IN THEIR ORDINARY LIVES ON EARTH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002074.wav|4|I FELT VERY QUEER INDEED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002167.wav|4|I TURNED QUICKLY , AND SENT THE JET OF LIGHT DARTING ACROSS AND ACROSS THE REAR END OF THE CHAPEL THEN ON EACH SIDE OF ME , BEFORE AND BEHIND , UP AT THE ROOF AND DOWN AT THE MARBLE FLOOR , BUT NOWHERE WAS THERE ANY VISIBLE THING TO PUT ME IN FEAR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000113.wav|1|BUT IT WAS TOO SLIPPERY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000710.wav|2|THERE REMAINED PLENTY OF GROUND LEFT OVER FROM THE FIVE ACRES , SO JOHN ENDLICH TINKERED WITH THAT FIFTY-MILLION-YEAR-OLD TRACTOR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000199.wav|1|BUT HER VOICE SOUNDED HOARSE AND STRANGE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000114.wav|1|AND WHEN SHE HAD TIRED HERSELF OUT WITH TRYING ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000347.wav|1|WRAPPED UP IN BLANKETS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000418.wav|1|WHERE CAN I HAVE DROPPED THEM , I WONDER ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000292.wav|2|SHE TOUCHED THE DESSICATED SOIL WITH A GAUNTLETED HAND .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000431.wav|4|SUDDENLY , AS I CROUCHED THERE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000823.wav|4|FIVE INCHES APART .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000065.wav|1|ALICE OPENED THE DOOR , AND LOOKED DOWN A SMALL PASSAGE ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000497.wav|2|HE HARDLY HEARD THEIR FRIGHTENED QUESTIONS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000230.wav|2|PERHAPS THERE WAS A SHORT AND TERRIBLE PASSING OF FLAME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000934.wav|4|IT CONVEYED TO ME SUCH A SENSE OF A CALM DELIBERATE FORCE PRESENT IN THE HALL THE STEADFAST INTENTION TO MAKE A DARKNESS WAS HORRIBLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000769.wav|4|WENTWORTH SENT FOR ME THE FOLLOWING DAY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000094.wav|4|THERE'S SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000844.wav|2|HIS SQUINTY EYES GLEAMED AND HE CHARGED INTO THE BAR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001346.wav|4|IN THE MORNING , I WENT ALONG TO THE ROOM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002304.wav|4|LIFTING IT OUT ONCE OR TWICE TO MAKE A MORE EXACT SCRUTINY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001252.wav|4|I FEEL THAT THERE IS SOMETHING BEASTLY AND DANGEROUS ABOUT THIS THING
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000188.wav|1|AND OH DEAR ! HOW PUZZLING IT ALL IS !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000462.wav|2|BUT WHEN NEELY GOT UP , HE HAD DRAWN HIS BLASTER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002199.wav|4|CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW I FELT ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001202.wav|4|WE'VE CARRIED OUR GUNS EVER SINCE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000339.wav|2|AND SO SUDDENLY HAD VESTA BEEN CHILLED IN THE COLD OF SPACE AT THE TIME OF THE PARENT BODY'S EXPLOSION ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002065.wav|4|I HAD BEEN SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME MAKING MY PREPARATIONS AND I FOUND THAT NOW THE BIG HALL AND STAIRCASE WERE IN DARKNESS AND ALL THE HOUSE SEEMED QUIET .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002376.wav|4|AND SAW HIM GLANCE SWIFTLY TOWARD THE ENTRANCE OF THE CHAPEL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000949.wav|2|TO TRY THE PEACEMAKING OF APPEASEMENT , WOULD HAVE PROBABLY THE SAME RESULT PLUS , FOR HIMSELF , THE DISHONOR OF CONTEMPT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000246.wav|2|HERE WAS A GHOST-LAND , HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES IN EXTENT A REGION THAT HAD BEEN SHIFTED IN A FEW SECONDS , FROM THE FULL PRIME OF LIFE AND MOTION ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000248.wav|4|WE BOTH WENT ALONG TO THE GREY ROOM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001982.wav|4|IT IS VERY MASSIVELY BUILT , AND ENTERED THROUGH ONLY ONE DOOR , WHICH LEADS OUT OF THE CASTLE ITSELF ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000550.wav|4|AS I WAS SAYING , I WORKED WITH ALL MY SPEED TO GET THE BARRIER COMPLETED ABOUT ME AND THE RING ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000343.wav|1|AFTER A TIME THE DODO BECAME IMPATIENT , AND , LEAVING THE DUCK TO BRING UP THE REST OF THE PARTY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000690.wav|4|DENNIS WAS DOING HIS BEST TO KEEP WENTWORTH FROM GOING BACK BUT HE WAS A SENSIBLE MAN IN HIS WAY ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000501.wav|1|BUT SHE HEARD A LITTLE SHRIEK AND A FALL AND A CRASH OF BREAKING GLASS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000654.wav|2|IT WAS A MAD DAY OF TOIL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000806.wav|4|OUTSIDE OF THE PENTACLE , I MADE A CIRCLE WITH GARLIC .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000727.wav|2|THE SWEETCORN RUSTLED IN THE WIND OF FANS HE'D SET UP TO CIRCULATE THE AIR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000656.wav|4|TRAMPS HAD TO DIE SOME TIME , AND IN SOME PLACE , AND IT PROVED NOTHING THAT TWO , OUT OF POSSIBLY HUNDREDS WHO HAD SLEPT IN THE EMPTY HOUSE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000118.wav|4|I FELT EASIER THEN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000721.wav|4|SO AS TO MAKE THINGS SEEM CHEERFUL AND TO GET THEM YEARNING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001199.wav|2|THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE OUR NEW NEIGHBORS , JOHNNY ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000354.wav|1|WHICH WAS COILED NEARLY ALL ROUND THE PARTY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001007.wav|2|HE SAW AT LEAST A SCORE OF SHAPES IN SPACE ARMOR , ARCING NEARER SPECKS IN HUMAN FORM , GLOWING WITH REFLECTED SUNLIGHT , LIKE LITTLE HURTLING MOONS AMONG THE STARS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000796.wav|4|I GAVE THEM A GOOD FEED AND AFTER THAT WE ALL SET OUT FOR THE MANOR .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000658.wav|2|AND HE DID GET THE HOUSE ASSEMBLED SO THAT ROSE AND THE KIDS AND HE COULD SLEEP INSIDE ITS SEALED DOORS .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002112.wav|4|AND THEN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000126.wav|2|THE SILENCE OF A VACUUM , AND OF UNTHINKABLE DISTANCES , AND OF GHOSTLY REMAINS WHICH MUST BE LEFT ON THIS FRAGMENT OF A WORLD THAT HAD BLOWN UP , MAYBE FIFTY MILLION OR MORE YEARS AGO ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000847.wav|4|THEN I WENT ROUND THE LITTLE STAR OF MEN , AND WARNED THEM NOT TO BE FRIGHTENED WHATEVER HAPPENED BUT TO TRUST TO THE DEFENSE AND TO LET NOTHING TEMPT OR DRIVE THEM TO CROSS THE BARRIERS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002220.wav|4|THIS WAS SO REAL , THAT I SUFFERED AN ACTUAL PAIN , MOST PECULIAR AND AT THE SAME TIME INTENSE THE WHOLE HEAD PAINED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001159.wav|4|DO YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBILITIES YES , I SAID . PERHAPS I DO IN A VAGUE SORT OF WAY BUT I DON'T SEE HOW ALL THIS AFFECTS THE ROOM
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002152.wav|4|IT WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY SENSIBLE NOTION , FOR THE SOUND WAS FAR TOO HEAVY AND RESONANT FOR SUCH A CAUSE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000236.wav|4|THAT WAS JUST WHAT I THOUGHT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000565.wav|2|A FAINT VIBRATION WAS TRANSMITTED TO HIS GLOVED HAND . AND THE GLOBE IN THE CEILING BEGAN TO GLOW .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000688_S0000219.wav|3|PATROBAS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000604.wav|4|NOTHING IN THE ROOM WAS TOUCHED , AND I KNEW THAT THE BRUTE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO CROSS THE PENTACLES .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000697.wav|2|ANYHOW , MR . MAHONEY SAID THAT WE SHOULD KEEP ON EXERCISING ALL REASONABLE CAUTION
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000144.wav|1|AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000148.wav|4|THE DOOR HAD NOT SLAMMED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR , AND I WAS GETTING BACK MY NERVE AGAIN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002163.wav|4|I FOUND IT CLOSE TO ME , ON THE PEW SEAT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000795.wav|4|WHEN THE CONSTABLES ARRIVED EARLY THAT EVENING AT THE INN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000764.wav|4|AND THERE WAS A HORRIBLE LITTLE SILENCE , WITH EVERYONE STANDING RIGID .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000413.wav|1|IF SHE HAD NOT SUDDENLY CAUGHT THE SOUND OF PATTERING FEET .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000785.wav|1|SAID THE MOCK TURTLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000990.wav|4|I SAW SEVERAL GREAT DROPS SPLASH AND STAR UPON THE PALE GLOWING INTERTWINING TUBES OF THE ELECTRIC PENTACLE BUT , STRANGELY ENOUGH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001034.wav|2|THEN HE SAW HIS PALS , LANDING LIKE A FLOCK OF BIRDS , JUST BEYOND THE TRANSPARENT SIDE OF THE GREENHOUSE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000490.wav|2|MAYBE WE'LL BE BACK TONIGHT . BUT DON'T WAIT UP FOR US .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000639.wav|1|IS THAT ALL ? SAID ALICE , SWALLOWING DOWN HER ANGER AS WELL AS SHE COULD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000451.wav|1|SHE FOUND HER HEAD PRESSING AGAINST THE CEILING ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000576.wav|1|AND EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER ITS FEET ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000328.wav|4|YET , TO WHAT EXTENT MATERIALIZATION OF AN AB-NATURAL CREATURE IS POSSIBLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001904.wav|4|WHEN I GOT THERE , I FOUND THAT THEY HAVE AN OLD CHAPEL ATTACHED TO THE CASTLE WHICH HAS HAD QUITE A DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION FOR BEING WHAT IS POPULARLY TERMED HAUNTED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000302.wav|2|IN SHORT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000021.wav|4|I RECEIVED A LETTER A FORTNIGHT AGO FROM A MAN I MUST CALL ANDERSON ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000910.wav|2|BUT THAT HE WAS OUT OF ACTION SIGNIFIED NO PEACE , WHEN SO MANY OF HIS BUDDIES WERE NEARBY , AND BEGINNING TO SEETHE , LIKE A SWARM OF HORNETS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000028.wav|2|HI ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000426.wav|4|IT SEEMED TO BE HURLED BACK BY SOME MIGHTY , INVISIBLE FORCE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000403.wav|1|ON VARIOUS PRETEXTS , THEY ALL MOVED OFF ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000108.wav|2|HER BEGGING COULD NOT HAVE STOPPED HIM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000853.wav|2|IT WAS TO HIS CREDIT THAT HE DID SO QUITE COOLLY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000712.wav|1|THE LOBSTER QUADRILLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000911.wav|4|AND I COULD SEE THEM LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH THEIR PAWS OVER THEIR NOSES , IN A MOST PECULIAR FASHION , AND SHIVERING VISIBLY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000602.wav|4|THE GATEWAY OF THE MONSTER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000221.wav|4|THE SOUND SEEMED TO FILL THE WHOLE OF THE LARGE CORRIDOR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000462.wav|1|THE LITTLE MAGIC BOTTLE HAD NOW HAD ITS FULL EFFECT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000014.wav|4|ALONG WITH HIS PIPE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002400.wav|4|SO THAT IT OPENED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000461.wav|1|LUCKILY FOR ALICE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000825.wav|1|AND , TAKING ALICE BY THE HAND , HE HURRIED OFF , WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE END OF THE SONG .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000323.wav|1|I THOUGHT YOU DID , SAID THE MOUSE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000227.wav|2|PERHAPS IN THE SAME CONFLICT ?
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001017.wav|2|ENDLICH WAS ANYTHING BUT CALM INSIDE , WITH THE WILD HORDE , AS IRRESPONSIBLE IN THEIR PRESENT STATE OF MIND AS A PACK OF IDIOT BABOONS , BEARING DOWN ON HIM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000559.wav|2|NOTHING COULD HAVE DAMAGED IT VERY MUCH , IN THE FRIGID STILLNESS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001033.wav|4|THE NEGATIVE HAD SHOWED ME SOMETHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000149.wav|2|THE HOLD-PORT WAS CLOSED ABRUPTLY BY A MECHANISM THAT COULD BE OPERATED ONLY FROM THE MAIN CONTROL-BOARD .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001931.wav|4|EITHER BY THE AID OF SOME INHERENT FORCE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000234.wav|2|THERE HAD BEEN NO AIR LEFT TO SUSTAIN COMBUSTION , SO BUILDINGS AND TREES HAD NOT CONTINUED TO BURN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000191.wav|2|THE OTHER SIDE WAS JAGGED AND BROKEN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001852.wav|4|THERE IS ONE THOUGHT , WHICH IS OFTEN MINE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000797.wav|1|I'VE FORGOTTEN THE WORDS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000895.wav|4|THE EFFECT OF THE BRIGHT LIGHT PASSED , AND I COULD SEE CLEARLY AGAIN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002122.wav|4|AND THEN , ABRUPTLY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002067.wav|4|THEN , VERY SLOWLY AND SILENTLY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO THE HALL AND TURNED INTO THE PASSAGE THAT LED TO THE CHAPEL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000180.wav|4|I EXAMINED ALL MY SEALS , AND NOT A SINGLE ONE WAS DISTURBED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001040.wav|2|HIS BATTERED AND BLOODIED LIP CURLED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001177.wav|2|HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT . HIS MOUTH HUNG PARTLY OPEN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000649.wav|1|SAID THE CATERPILLAR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000808.wav|4|WHEN THIS WAS DONE , I CLEARED THE WHOLE CENTER OF THE HALL , AND PUT ONE OF THE POLICEMEN TO SWEEP IT AFTER WHICH I HAD ALL MY APPARATUS CARRIED INTO THE CLEARED SPACE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002200.wav|4|I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001326.wav|4|FOR A LONG TIME I LAY AWAKE BUT MANAGED EVENTUALLY TO GET SOME SLEEP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000421.wav|1|BUT THEY WERE NOW NOWHERE TO BE SEEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED SINCE HER SWIM IN THE POOL ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000295.wav|2|YOU CAN SEE THE SPLASH-MARKS OF THE LAST RAIN THAT EVER FELL HERE YEAH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000173.wav|4|I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT THE BRUTES HAVE BEEN UP TO .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000780.wav|1|THEN , YOU KNOW , CONTINUED THE MOCK TURTLE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000455.wav|4|ABRUPTLY , I STRETCHED A TIRED LEG , AND KNOCKED OVER ONE OF THE JARS OF WATER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000327.wav|2|A PISTOL AND AMMUNITION .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000148.wav|1|AND SHE AT ONCE TOOK UP THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000816.wav|2|SO FAR , FINE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000445.wav|4|THAT MADE ME FEEL RATHER QUEER .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000086.wav|4|ALL THE SAME , I HAD TO MAKE THE ROOM SO THAT I SHOULD KNOW IF ANYTHING MATERIAL ENTERED IT SO I ASKED HIM NOT TO BOTHER ME , UNLESS HE REALLY HEARD OR SAW SOMETHING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002166.wav|4|BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING TO FRIGHTEN ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000249.wav|2|A REVULSION ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000463.wav|4|WHICH IS FELT ONLY UPON THE TOO NEAR APPROACH OF THE AB-HUMAN , AND IS MORE DREADFUL , IN A STRANGE WAY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000629.wav|2|THE WALLS OF THE SMALL TENT AROUND ENDLICH SAGGED , WHERE THEY HAD BULGED TAUTLY BEFORE SHOWING THAT THERE WAS NOW A FIRM AND EQUAL PRESSURE BEYOND THEM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002091.wav|4|AT THE CONCLUSION OF MY SEARCH I WALKED ACROSS TO WHERE I HAD LEFT MY CAMERA FOCUSED UPON THE CHANCEL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001943.wav|4|AFTER CONCLUDING HIS DUTIES AT THE PUBLIC CHURCH ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001036.wav|4|I TOOK MY REVOLVER , AND WENT QUIETLY DOWNSTAIRS , AND INTO THE DARK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000934.wav|2|OKAY FINE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000148.wav|2|REPRIEVE CAME PRESUMABLY BY WAY OF THE GOOD-SENSE OF THE PILOT OF THE SPACE SHIP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000372.wav|4|AND REACHED ROUND FOR IT BUT WITHOUT LOOKING AWAY FROM THE BED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000145.wav|4|THEN I SAT ON THE BED ALL NIGHT , AND LISTENED TO THE DISMAL THUDDING OF A DOOR UP THE CORRIDOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000012.wav|2|REMEMBER WE'VE GOT TO MAKE GOOD HERE , JOHNNY ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000384.wav|2|EXCHANGED BY SHORT-RANGE RADIO BY MEN IN SPACE ARMOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000157.wav|4|WENT QUIETLY ALONG THE PASSAGE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000536.wav|4|I UNMADE THE PENTACLE , FOR IT MUST BE MADE AFRESH AND AROUND THE ONE TO BE PROTECTED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001930.wav|4|AND I FOUND EVERYONE IN A HALF BELIEF THAT THE QUEER OLD WEAPON DID REALLY STRIKE THE BUTLER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000175.wav|2|DAMN HIS OWN DUMB HIDE ! DAMN THE MIGHTY URGE TO GET DRUNK !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000529.wav|4|I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000405.wav|4|I TELL YOU IT WAS MOST HORRIBLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001231.wav|4|AND IN THE YELLOW FINGER EXPERIMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER TIMES .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002204.wav|4|SOME PARTICULARLY LONG MINUTES PASSED , ABOUT THIS TIME BUT I THINK MY NERVES MUST HAVE QUIETED A BIT FOR I REMEMBER BEING SUFFICIENTLY AWARE OF MY FEELINGS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002066.wav|4|I STEPPED BACK AND CLOSED AND LOCKED MY DOOR .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002338.wav|4|HE ADDED , ALSO , THAT EVEN BEFORE THE HORRIBLE ATTACK ON THE BUTLER HIS FATHER HAD BEEN JUST AS PARTICULAR ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000688_S0000076.wav|3|THUS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD IN WHOM HE BELIEVED , WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE DEAD AND MAKES REFERENCE TO THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST , AS THOUGH THEY DID ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000846.wav|1|HOLD YOUR TONGUE !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000488.wav|1|THEN CAME A LITTLE PATTERING OF FEET ON THE STAIRS
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001893.wav|4|CARNACKI SNUGGED HIMSELF DOWN INTO HIS GREAT CHAIR , AS I HAVE SAID WAS HIS HABIT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000160.wav|4|HULLO , PETER I SAID , FEELING SUDDENLY CHEERFUL FOR I WAS AS GLAD AS ANY LOST CHILD TO HAVE A LIVE HUMAN BEING CLOSE TO ME . WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO WITH THE REFRESHMENTS
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000142.wav|2|IN JOHN ENDLICH THE RAGE OF INTOLERABLE INSULTS STILL SEETHED .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000598.wav|1|SHE STRETCHED HERSELF UP ON TIPTOE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000090.wav|4|ALL THIS HAD TAKEN ME FAR LONGER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED AND , SUDDENLY , I HEARD A CLOCK STRIKE ELEVEN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001371.wav|4|THAT SOMEONE KNEW THE SECRET OF THE MACHINERY , AND WAS UTILIZING THE KNOWLEDGE TO PLAY THIS DEVIL OF A PRANK ON TASSOC .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000190.wav|4|THIS , I MUST HAVE SPENT A FULL HOUR OVER ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002100.wav|4|I CANNOT SAY WHAT I EXPECTED TO HAPPEN ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000910.wav|4|PRESENTLY , HOWEVER , THEY CEASED EVEN FROM THIS ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001360.wav|4|THEN I CAME DOWN , AND WENT OVER THE WHOLE OF THE ROOM FLOOR , CEILING , AND WALLS , MAPPING THEM OUT IN SIX-INCH SQUARES , AND SOUNDING WITH BOTH HAMMER AND PROBE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000931.wav|2|YOU AIN'T KIDDIN' ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001449.wav|4|HIS FACE SEEMED TO BE BADLY SCARRED AND BRUISED AND HIS RIGHT HAND WAS BANDAGED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000800.wav|2|RELEASED A LITTLE , IT EXCITED HIM MORE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000128.wav|1|AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT SHE REMAINED THE SAME SIZE TO BE SURE THIS IS WHAT GENERALLY HAPPENS WHEN ONE EATS CAKE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000035.wav|2|TIED TO BABY'S DIAPER SUSPENDERS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001190.wav|4|THAT'S HOW IT MAKES YOU FEEL .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001115.wav|4|PERHAPS THEY HAPPENED TO FIND OUT SOMETHING , AND WERE GIVEN A HYPODERMIC .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000903.wav|2|WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS MUSCULAR BODY , BACKED UP BY DREAD AND PENT-UP FURY , HE SENT A GLOVED FIST CRASHING STRAIGHT INTO NEELY'S OPEN FACE-WINDOW .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000507.wav|4|IT WAS A SMALL OBJECT , AND I TOOK IT TO THE WINDOW .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000638.wav|4|WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS LOOK ROUND , HE WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE , MEANING TO SEE THE ONE-TIME AGENT OF THE ESTATE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000115.wav|2|BUT IN A BODY THEY AROSE FROM THEIR TRAVELER-SEATS ABOARD THE SHIP .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000553.wav|2|BUT THE THING WHICH INTERESTED HIM MOST WAS THE PATTERN OF COPPER RIBBONS ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000714.wav|2|THEN HE HARROWED THE GROUND AGAIN .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000573.wav|1|AND , THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED AT THE OTHER SIDE ,
