/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000571.wav|112|AND THE CURRENT WAS DIRECT AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000162.wav|111|AND DRIED HER EYES TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001063.wav|114|AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS A REPETITION OF THE UNCOMFORTABLE BREAKING SOUND , I HAD HEARD EARLIER IN THE NIGHT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000941.wav|112|SOMETHING PASTORAL AND BEAUTIFUL AND ORDERLY GAINED WITH HARD WORK .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000420.wav|112|THE BOX THAT CONTAINED THE MEANS OF SURVIVAL FOR HIS FAMILY AND HIMSELF , AS IF HE FORESAW THE FUTURE , A MOMENT AWAY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000141.wav|114|I'VE GONE INTO TOO MANY CASES CONNECTED WITH GHOSTLY THINGS , TO BE ACCUSED OF THAT BUT I TELL YOU I FUNKED IT SIMPLY FUNKED IT ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002396.wav|114|AND LOOKING NO DIFFERENT FROM THE SURROUNDING SURFACE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001046.wav|114|I LOOKED UP IT , AND SAW A FAINT FLICKER OF LIGHT AWAY AT THE END AND I TIPTOED SILENTLY TOWARD IT , HOLDING MY REVOLVER READY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000580.wav|111|WITH ITS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF ITS MOUTH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000476.wav|114|AND ALL THE TIME THE HORRIBLE WIND WAS BLOWING UPON ME FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM TO THE LEFT OF THE BED .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000574.wav|114|SUDDENLY , I REALIZED THAT I WAS IN MORE THAN ANY MORTAL DANGER FOR THE CONVOLUTING SHADOWS ABOUT THE RING WERE TAKING SHAPE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000017.wav|112|WHAT IF WE ARE THE FIRST FARMERS TO COME TO VESTA .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000312.wav|114|WHICH IS A MOST MARVELOUS DEFENSE AGAINST CERTAIN MANIFESTATIONS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002401.wav|114|INSTANTLY THERE WAS A LOUD THUD ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000039.wav|111|AND HAD JUST BEGUN TO DREAM THAT SHE WAS WALKING HAND IN HAND WITH DINAH ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000680.wav|114|HE SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD STAY WITH HIM , AND KEEP HIM COMPANY THROUGH THE NIGHT .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000071.wav|112|WHERE ARE THEY , PAPA .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001047.wav|114|AS I CAME NEAR TO THE OPEN DOOR , I HEARD MEN'S VOICES , AND THEN A BURST OF LAUGHING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001372.wav|114|THE MICROPHONE TEST OF THE WALLS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE THIS KNOWN TO ME , AS I HAVE SAID BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT IN THE CASTLE SO THAT I HAD PRACTICALLY NO DOUBT AT ALL NOW , BUT THAT IT WAS A GENUINE CASE OF WHAT IS POPULARLY TERMED HAUNTING .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002280.wav|114|I DID NOT WAIT , BUT KNOCKED UNTIL HE APPEARED WITH HIS COAT OFF , EVIDENTLY IN THE ACT OF DEALING WITH HIS BREAKFAST .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000327.wav|114|THEN I TESTED MY REVOLVER , CAREFULLY , THOUGH I HAD LITTLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NEEDED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000518.wav|112|THE EDGES OF THE PLASTIC WERE THEN ATTACHED TO MASSIVE METAL RAILS , WHICH HE BURIED IN THE TRENCH .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000445.wav|111|BUT NONETHELESS SHE UNCORKED IT AND PUT IT TO HER LIPS I KNOW SOMETHING INTERESTING IS SURE TO HAPPEN , SHE SAID TO HERSELF ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000999.wav|114|LIKE LIGHTNING , THE THOUGHT SPRANG INTO MY BRAIN IT HAS CROSSED THE PENTACLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000759.wav|112|SURE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002314.wav|114|I PUT THEM INTO METHYLATED SPIRITS FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001260.wav|114|OF WHICH I HAD RETAINED THE KEY .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000969.wav|114|MY HANDS WERE SIMPLY SOAKED WITH SWEAT .

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000502.wav|111|FROM WHICH SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE IT HAD FALLEN INTO A CUCUMBER-FRAME ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000198.wav|111|AND BEGAN ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000813.wav|111|THE MOCK TURTLE SIGHED DEEPLY , AND BEGAN , IN A VOICE SOMETIMES CHOKED WITH SOBS , TO SING THIS
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001373.wav|114|ALL THIS TIME , EVERY NIGHT , AND SOMETIMES MOST OF EACH NIGHT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000582.wav|114|A GREAT , BLACK SHADOW COVERED IT , AND ROSE INTO THE AIR , AND CAME AT ME .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000074.wav|114|I LIT THE LOT , AND AFTER THAT ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0001078.wav|112|GET AWAY WITH YOUR DAMNED GARDEN TRUCK !
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000359.wav|114|I LOST THE THING AMID THE VAGUENESS , AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO I GLANCED SWIFTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000633.wav|114|AS IT IS USUALLY TERMED .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000402.wav|111|SHE'S NO FIT COMPANY FOR YOU !

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0002042.wav|114|THE SOAP I LEFT WITH THE LOCAL IRONMONGER , WHO WAS SOMETHING OF A LOCKSMITH AND PROMISED TO LET ME HAVE MY DUPLICATE ,
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000626.wav|112|IT EVEN HAD AN INTER-SKIN LAYER OF GUM THAT COULD SEAL THE PUNCTURES THAT GRAIN-OF-SAND-SIZED METEORS MIGHT MAKE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000112.wav|114|AND SHOVED THEM INTO HIS HANDS .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0001073.wav|114|AND I HEARD THE SLIGHT , RINGING JANGLE OF STEEL WIRE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001381_S0000579.wav|114|THEN , WITH A MAD , AWKWARD MOVEMENT , I SNATCHED AT THE RING , INTENDING TO HURL IT OUT OF THE PENTACLE .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000917.wav|112|HE PRESSED THE CONTROL-BUTTON OF THE LOCK , AND SQUIRMED THROUGH ITS DOUBLE VALVES BEFORE THE STARTLED GUARD COULD STOP HIM .
/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000000468_S0000255.wav|111|AFRAID THAT SHE HAD HURT THE POOR ANIMAL'S FEELINGS ,

/home/angadjeet22071/generative_audiobooks/wav_files/wavAUD0000001043_S0000437.wav|112|HE DID JUST THAT WHEN HE RAISED HIS PISTOL , STRUGGLING AGAINST THE AWFUL IMPULSE OF THE RAGE IN HIM LIFTED IT HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT THE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS THAT SPEWED FROM IT WOULD BE SURE TO PASS OVER THE HEADS OF THE DARK SILHOUETTES THAT WERE MOVING ABOUT .
